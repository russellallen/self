Logging
*******

"log" is a useful system-wide logging mechanism. You can find it in
the "system" category of "globals".


How to log
==========

There are a number of useful messages in the "logging" category of
"log" which allow you to simply and cleanly log messages. For example:

   log warn: 'This is a warning.'

You can log with one of five levels found at "log levels". These are,
in order of severity, "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "fatal".

You can also tag log entries, for example:

   log fatal: 'The server has caught fire' For: 'webserver'

By default, entries of either error or fatal severity which aren't
tagged are logged to stderr in the form:

   [Thu Oct 23 16:25:07 2014] error -- Something went wrong!


How logging works
=================

The helper methods shown above constuct a "log entry" and hand it to
the "log dispatcher". The dispatcher has a number of handlers, each is
given a chance to handle the log entry. The handlers can choose which
entries to act on. Example handlers are in "log prototypeHandlers".

When making a handler, please keep in mind that the log entry's
"message" is expected to be something which understands "value",
returning an object (or itself) which understands "asString". If you
do not need to resolve the message by sending it "value" please don't;
that way logs can be sent blocks which are only resolved if necessary;
eg:

   log debug: ['We have reached: ', somethingComplicatedToCalculate]

will not slow down your code if no log handler is interested in
handling debuggers.

If your handler breaks the logging process you can restart it by:

   log dispatcher hup
