Sifting Out the Gold: Delivering Compact Applications From an Exploratory Object-Oriented Environment
=====================================================================================================

Ole Agesen and David Ungar

**Abstract:**

Integrated, dynamically-typed object-oriented programming environments 
offer many advantages, but have trouble producing small, self-contained
applications. Recent advances in type inference have made it possible to 
build an application extractor for Self. The extractor was able to extract 
a medium-sized application in a few minutes. The extracted application 
runs in a tenth the space of the original environment. Except for extracting
reflection and sends with computed selectors, the extractor runs without
human intervention and fully preserves the behavior of the application.
