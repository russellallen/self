<h1>Is this Kansas?</h1>
Thanks for taking the time to help us out.  Below you will find three
applets.  The largest one is the browser window.  It has navigation
controls all around it, and you will find it in the login state.  
You need to type in your name and hit the "Reconnect" button to join
the world.  From there you can use the navigation buttons to move
around.  The two red/green indicators can tell you if the server is
caught up with you or not.  The one on the right is the more reliable
one, and you should probably refrain from further action when it is
stuck red.  If it sticks for an abnormally long time, try clicking on
it (which will turn it green) and then moving the mouse in the window.
If it sticks red again then you should keep waiting.
<p>
The other two applets are a disconnect button and a smaller browser 
which gives you a radar
view of the world.  You can connect this if you want (note that it
asks for your name but doens't actually use it in any way).  This 
gives a condensed view of the world, and you can navigate in this view
using the navigation buttons as well.  Note that you cannot change the
world using this viewer.  The disconnect button will close down the
connections for both the regular and the rader browsers, and return
them to the login state.  If things get stuck, go ahead and do this.
Note that if you disconnect and reconnect you will be returned to the
same place in the world that you left.  If you get lost, you are 
better off opening the radar viewer to find yourself.
<p>
In terms of using the world, you use your left mouse button to select
and pick up objects in the world.  You should become immediately aware
of a text widget with your name on it.  This is provided to let you talk
to the other users.  Click on it and type.  Please don't type on other
people's text widgets, it's not polite (and will also be prohibited in
the future).  Note that you are responsible
for hitting enter rather than running off the end of the line (future
versions will word-wrap, I promise).  Note also that the arrow keys
are broken in Netscape.  You will have to use the Emacs shortcuts instead
(ctrl-F and crtl-B are forward and back on a line, ctrl-N and ctrl-P are
next and previous lines, ctrl-A is home and ctrl-E is end)
<p>
The reality check information on the browser is as follows:
<ul>
   <li> The text at the top should say "Kansas viewer: built Tue Sep 10 10:57:27
        PDT 1996 on host ourselves"
   <li> The login name should be "java user" by default, change this
   <li> The password field should be blank
   <li> The hostname (for the server) should be inherit
   <li> The port number should be 1420
</ul>
<p>
If clicking reconnect brings you back to the login prompt, then try it 
again.  If it fails two or three times in a row, call me.  Please be patient
when joining the world or moving around in areas with many objects.

If you have problems, my extension is x61604 (Andy), or you can email me

Have fun!  Further instructions await you in Kansas.
