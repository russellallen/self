# Root Makefile

# You should set the SELF_BASELINE_DIR environment variable to the 
#   root directory of the self baseline, say ~self.
# You may want to set the SELF_WORKING_DIR environment variable to the
#   root directory of your local working tree, say ~/self.
# Finally, your path should include
#   {$SELF_WORKING_DIR,$SELF_BASELINE_DIR}/bin/{shell,`arch`}
#   before using make.


# The make files require GNU make -- Sun's make won't run them.  If
# GNU make is installed as gmake (or under any other name), change the
# line below accordingly.
